# About Modern Minimalist

Modern Minimalist is a clean, elegant Jekyll theme designed for content-focused blogs and personal websites. Taking inspiration from popular publishing platforms like Medium and Ghost, this theme prioritizes readability and content presentation.

## Features

- **Clean Typography**: Optimized for comfortable reading with carefully selected font sizes, line heights, and spacing.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Focuses on what matters most - your content - with subtle design elements that enhance without distracting.
- **Modern Touches**: Smooth animations, well-designed navigation, and thoughtful social sharing options.

## Design Philosophy

We believe that great design gets out of the way. This theme was built with a focus on:

- **Readability First**: Typography is treated as a first-class citizen with careful attention to font choices, line length, and contrast.
- **Meaningful Whitespace**: Generous spacing helps organize content and guides the reader through the page.
- **Content Hierarchy**: Clear visual distinction between headings, body text, and supporting elements.
- **Performance**: Optimized code and assets for fast loading times and smooth scrolling.

## Getting Started

This theme is easy to customize through the `_config.yml` file. You can change colors, fonts, and layout settings to match your personal style or brand.
